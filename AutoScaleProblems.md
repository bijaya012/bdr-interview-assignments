# Autoscale Home Assignments

1. For each of these problems please be ready with your strategy to use parallel threads/nodes and think about fault tolerance. That may be discussed in the interview.
2. Document your design considerations and assumptions.
3. Keep the code/pseudo-code readable and succint


## Option 1 - [BrainVita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peg_solitaire) solver

Design a solver for BrainVita with variable board size.

Languages to chose from: C or C++ like pseudo-code

## Option 2 - [TicTacToe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) solver

Design and implement the computer player algorithm for TicTacToe game. Specifically, given a state of game where the computer player is supposed to make the next move, compute the best move it should make. Assume variable sized board.

Languages to chose from: C, C++, like pseudo-code

## Option 3 - [SnakesAndLadders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes_and_ladders) solver

Given a board of snakes and ladders i.e. size of the board and start and end positions of snakes and ladders, design and implement an algorithm to find the minimum number of moves it will take for a winner to reach the end position. Also record the moves.
